# FormForm 3.0: Automated activity promotion generator

### Description

This is a project designed to automate the process of creating the promotions for the ESN activities. The way this is done is by generating an instagram history image and a message template (To be shared on diffusion channels for Erasmus groups) based on the entries from an activity registration form. The target audience would be the activities organizators.

The main aim of this project is to make it easier for the organizators to create promotional material for the activities at the time of filling the activity registration form. Once the form is filled, the organizator receives a message by email with the generated message template and the instagram history image. It is stored as well in a Google Drive folder to be uploaded with the rest of the images each sunday to the section Instagram in order to inform the Erasmus people about the upcoming activities.


### Setup

### Demonstration

### Future updates
Adding connection to tools like GPT-3 would enhance (and even neutralize) refinement for message templates in the future, as it would reflect with detail the description of the activity.
